<body>
	<h1>Difference between var, let and const</h1>
	<p>Outputs can be seen in console (press F12).</p>
	<p>Example 1: </p>
	<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) { <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   console.log(i);<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp }<br>

		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp console.log(i);
	</p>
	<button onclick="for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {console.log(i);}console.log(i)">Click to run</button>
	<p>Inference: The variable i is accessible outside of the for-loop. <br>This is expected since variables defined with var are only inaccessible outside of a function definition.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>Example 2: </p>
	<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp var foo = 1;<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp foo = 30;<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp var foo = 101;<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp console.log(foo);
	</p>
	<button onclick="var foo = 1;foo = 30;var foo = 101;console.log(foo)">Click to run</button>
	<p>Inference: Using var you can reassign it with a new value.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>Example 3: </p>
	<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   console.log(i);<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp }<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp console.log(i);
	</p>
	<button onclick="for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {console.log(i);}console.log(i)">Click to run</button>
	<p>Inference: let creates a variable which is available only inside the block in which it is defined.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>Example 4: </p>
	<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp let foo = 1;<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp foo = 30;<br>
	    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp // let foo = 101;    Ô∏è // can't use "let" keyword again<br>
	    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp foo = 101;<br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp console.log(foo);  
	</p>
	<button onclick="let foo = 1;foo = 30;foo = 101;console.log(foo)">Click to run</button>
	<p>Inference: let creates a variable which is available only inside the block in which it is defined.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>Example 5: </p>
	<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp const myBoolean = true;<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp if (myBoolean) {<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   const turtles = [<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 	'leonardo',<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 	'donatello',<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 	'michaelangelo',<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 	'raphael'<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   ];<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   // turtles = turtles.concat('Shredder');  // this would throw an error<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   console.log(turtles);<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp }<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp console.log(turtles);  
	</p>
	<button onclick="const myBoolean = true;if (myBoolean) {const turtles = ['leonardo','donatello','michaelangelo','raphael'];console.log(turtles);}console.log(turtles)">Click to run</button>
	<p>Inference: Items can still be added to a const variable that points to an array or an object, because the const is not being reassigned in such case.<br> It is available only in the block in which it is defined.</p>
